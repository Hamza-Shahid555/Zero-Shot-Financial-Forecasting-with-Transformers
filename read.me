> Can a model learn to trade Cryptocurrency by only observing the Stock Market?

This project implements a Transformer-based Deep Learning model for financial time-series forecasting. It explores the concept of Zero-Shot Transfer Learning
where the model is trained exclusively on S&P 500 equities (Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.)
and then evaluated on its ability to forecast Cryptocurrency assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum) without ever seeing them during training.

## 🚀 Key Features

* Universal Market Model:** A single model instance that handles multiple asset classes simultaneously.
* Asset Embeddings:** Uses learnable vector embeddings to capture the unique "identity" and volatility profile of each asset while sharing temporal weights.
* Transformer Encoder:** Replaces traditional RNNs/LSTMs with Multi-Head Attention to better capture long-range dependencies and market regimes over a 30-day lookback window.
* Zero-Shot Generalization:** Demonstrates that fundamental market dynamics (momentum, mean reversion) are transferable from traditional finance (TradFi) to decentralized finance (DeFi).
* Interactive Dashboard:** A built-in Streamlit app to visualize forecasts, attention weights, and validation metrics.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The model treats financial forecasting as a sequence modeling problem:

1. Input:** 30-day sequence of normalized returns + Technical Indicators (Moving Averages, Volatility).
2. Embedding Layer:** Maps the Asset ID (e.g., "AAPL") to a dense vector, which is concatenated with the time-series features.
3. Encoder:** A multi-layer Transformer Encoder processes the sequence.
4. Head:** A linear layer projects the encoded features to a 5-day return forecast.
